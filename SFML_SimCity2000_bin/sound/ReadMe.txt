Aditional info

Q. "Okay so what's with the ###.WAV and if it's the same as the PC version stuff?"
A. Because you can replace the sound files in the Windows version of SC2K.

Q. "Cool I can replace the sound files, do I need something special?"
A. No you copy and replace (assuming you backed-up of course) in the Sounds folder.

Q. "Can I use my own sounds for replacing in the Windows version?"
A. Yes but it needs to be a 11025Hz 8-bit Mono .WAV file.
